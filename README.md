# PebbleSlackDictation
A demo using Pebble's dictation API and IFTTT to post messages to Slack.

If this code helps you make something pretty cool, please do let me know! I'm on Twitter at @thatpatrickguy, or you can find me at http://www.patrickcatanzariti.com or http://www.patcat.com.

Keen for more of this sort of thing? This demo is part of an article at http://www.sitepoint.com. I've got a range of different IoT/wearable/VR/AR demos up there!

I've also got a site dedicated to developer resources for emerging tech like the IoT, wearables, VR, AR and artificial intelligence over at http://www.devdiner.com :)
